    <h2>
      Soundcloud Rap
    </h2>

    <p>
      Soundcloud rap is a newer subgenre of rap that began in the late 2010s. It got its start when artists began to release their own music on the platform 
      <br>
      SoundCloud, which also made it easier for artists to upload and share their work independently. Within
      <br>
      this subgenre, there are even more different styles that come from it. Three of the most prominent styles are <b>Rage</b>, <b>Emo Rap</b>, and <b>Drill</b>. All these different
      <br>
      styles have slightly different characteristics and elements.
    </p>

    <br>
    <br>

    <h3>
      Rage
    </h3>

    <p>
      Rage is a very high-energy subgenre of Soundcloud rap. It's known for it's prominent use of distorted 808s, frantic-sounding synths, and 
      <br>
      aggressive vocal delivery. Artists like <b>Playboi Carti, Yeat, Trippie Redd</b> and <b>Ken Carson</b> are some of the most popular artists in this subgenre. 
      <br>
      Rage incorporates some elements of punk rock and heavy metal, such as its distorted 808s and synths, while combining them with trap drums and effects. Rage lyrics are 
      <br>
      often delivered in an autotuned-mumble rap style, with more focus on creating an energetic atmosphere than on lyricism. Older hip-hop fans may not enjoy this subgenre as much,
      <br>
      as it differs from the traditional values of rap, but younger audiences have embraced it for the energetic atmosphere it creates. Some popular Rage songs 
      <br>
      include <em>"Sky"</em> by Playboi Carti, <em>"Miss the Rage"</em> by Trippie Redd and Playboi Carti, and <em>"Yale"</em> by Ken Carson.
      <br>
      Rage has gained popularity recently, and has become one of the most popular subgenres of not just Soundcloud Rap, but hip-hop as a whole.

      <br>
      in this subgenre. Emo Rap production often uses guitar riffs and melodies, trap drums, as well as lo-fi production techniques. In this subgenre, the vocals are delivered in both 
      <br>
      singing and rapping styles, with a focus on conveying emotion. Some popular Emo Rap songs are <em></em>"Lucid Dreams"</em> by Juice WRLD, <em>"XO Tour Llif3"</em> by Lil Uzi Vert, and <em>"SAD!"</em> by XXXTentacion. Emo Rap has grown
