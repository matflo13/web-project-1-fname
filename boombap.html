      Boom Bap is one of the most iconic subgenres of rap. Originating in New York City during the late 80s/early 90s,
      <br>
      this genre was one of the most prominent styles of rap in the Golden Age of Hip-hop.
      <br>
      The name <em>"Boom Bap"</em> comes from the sound of the drums. The hard-hitting <em>"BOOM"</em> of the kick drum 
      <br>
      and the thunderous <em>"BAP"</em> of the snare gave the genre its iconic name and sound.
      <br>
      The boom bap style of music usually consists of three components: Acoustic kicks and snares, a sample 
      <br>
      (usually taken from a jazz or soul record), 
      <br> 
      and of course, lyrics being rapped over the beat.
      <br>
      Some notable boom bap producers include <b>DJ Premier, J-Dilla, RZA, Pete Rock, and Madlib</b>, just to name a few.</b>
      <br>
      They all have their own distinct styles, but they all fall under the boom bap genre.
      <br>
      Many of the best rappers in the history of hip-hop come from the boom bap genre. A few examples are:
      <br>
      <b>Nas, Biggie, MF Doom, Wu-Tang Clan,</b> and <b>Jay-Z.</b>  Also, some of <b>Eminem's</b>  early work can be considered boom bap, but with more of a pop influence in it.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are many other prominent voices in the boom bap subgenre, but these are some of the best. Boom bap lyrics are a very big part of the genre. The topics typically talked 
      <br>
      about include personal struggles, social issues, urban life, using intricate rhyme schemes to tell stories in their songs.
      <br>
      The combination of vivid storytelling, hypnotizing instrumentals and powerful delivery the reason boom bap is 
      <br>
      considered one of, if not the most iconic hip-hop subgenre of all time.
