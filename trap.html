    <h2>
      Trap
    </h2>
    <p>
      Emerging out of the Southern United States, trap music is the most popular genre of rap in today. However, it wasn't always this mainstream. 
      <br>
      The trap subgenre dates back to the mid-1990s. Early trap producers such as <b>DJ Spanish Fly, DJ Toomp, 
      <br>
      Shawty Redd and DJ Paul</b> began shaping the new genre with their dark, gritty sounds and heavy use of <b>808 drum machines</b>.
      <br>
      This contrasted with the more upbeat, more acoustic, funk-influenced sounds of other rap subgenres at the time.
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>
      The term <em>"trap"</em> refers to places where <del>drug</del> deals happen (I know, not very school appropriate, but it's true), and the lyrics often reflect on the challenges of living that life.
      <br>
      Early trap artists like <b>Gucci Mane</b> and <b>Young Jeezy</b> for example, often talked about their lives in the <em>"trap"</em> and the struggle that came with it.

    <p>
      Trap music rose to mainstream popularity in the 2000s. <b>T.I.</b> and 
      <br>
      <b>2 Chainz</b> from Atlanta were some of the first trap artists to achieve mainstream success, with T.I.'s 2003 album <em>"Trap Muzik"</em> being a big milestone for the 
      <br>
      genre. In addition, <b>Rick Ross</b> and <b>T-Pain</b> from Florida helped bring mainstream attention to the genre, with T-Pain inspiring the modern auto-tuned style of trap we
      <br>
      commonly hear nowadays. The Canadian rapper <b>Drake</b> brought pop/RnB influenced melodies to the genre as well, making his own unique sound. 
      <br>
      Also, <b>Three 6 Mafia</b> incorporated trap elements into a lot of their work during the early 2000s, helping popularize the sound even more.
      <br> 
      Their dark, eerie beats and aggressive lyrics were a big influence on the trap genre.
      <br>
      In the 2010s, trap music continued to evolve. Artists like <b>Future, Migos,</b> and <b>Young Thug</b> pushed the boundaries of the genre with their unique styles and sounds. The use of autotune became more and more common, 
      <br>
      and the instrumentals often featured more melodic sounds combined with the traditional heavy textures.

    <p>
      Today, trap music is one of the most popular genres of music in the world, with artists like <b>Travis Scott, 21 Savage,</b> and <b>Lil Baby</b> achieving massive success. Trap producers have also gotten quite popular, notably the Atlanta-based producer Metro Boomin. 
      <br>
      The genre has also influenced other music styles, including pop and electronic dance music (EDM), and even has its own subgenres within itself.
      <br>
      Some newer subgenres of trap include <b>Drill</b>, which started in Chicago and uses darker, more aggressive sounds and lyrics, and <b>Rage</b>, which incorporates elements of punk rock, EDM and heavy metal into trap music.
      <br>
      In conclusion, trap music has come a long way since its origins in the mid-1990s. From its gritty beginning to its current mainstream success, trap has become a very dominant force in the music industry. Its evolution will continue as many new artists bring fresh new ideas and sounds to the genre.
