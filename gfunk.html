    <h2>
      G-Funk
    </h2>
    
    <p>
      G-Funk is a subgenre of West-Coast hip-hop that emerged in the early 1990s in the Los Angeles area of the United States. It's known for
      <br>
      its smooth melodies, heavy use of synthesizers, and funk-inspired basslines. G-Funk usually incorporates elements of 1970s funk music
      <br>
      while putting a hip-hop style on top of it.  
      <br>
      G-Funk lyrics typically revolve around themes of street life, gang culture, and the struggles faced by 
      <br>
      individuals living in urban environments. However, it also often includes more laid-back and party-oriented themes, reflecting the genre's overall vibe.

    <p>
      Pioneers of the G-Funk subgenre include <b>N.W.A, Snoop Dogg, Warren G,</b> and <b>Nate Dogg</b>. <b>2Pac</b>, also known as <b>Tupac</b>, also played a significant role in shaping the genre. 
      <br>
      Their smooth beats and aggressive lyrics caught the attention of many. One song by N.W.A, <em>"Straight Outta Compton,"</em> is a perfect example of the G-Funk style with its heavy use of synthesizers 
      <br>
      and funk samples. Another N.W.A song, <em>F*** Tha Police,</em> was a protest against police brutality that stirred up controversy, even getting the FBI 
      <br>
      involved. In 1992, <b>Dr. Dre,</b> a rapper and producer from N.W.A released an album named <em>"The Chronic"</em> and is often credited with 
      <br>
      expanding the G-Funk sound and bringing it to mainstream popularity.

    <p>
      While not as popular today, G-Funk has had many artists incorporate some of its elements into their music. <b>Kendrick Lamar</b> has been known to implement G-Funk influences 
      <br>
      in his music, especially in his albums <em>"Good Kid, M.A.A.D City"</em> and <em>"To Pimp a Butterfly."</em> On tracks like <em>"M.A.A.D City,"</em> <em>"King Kunta,"</em> and <em>"Squabble Up,"</em> Kendrick raps
      <br>
      over G-Funk-inspired beats and basslines while putting a modern spin on the sound. Modern West Coast/G-Funk producers like <b>DJ Mustard</b> and <b>Tyler, The Creator</b> have also 
      <br>
      been known to incorporate G-Funk and West Coast elements into their production, while elevating it with modern sounds and textures.
